### Think back to last time you discovered something that was surprising or unexpected. How did you feel? You might have felt the desire to learn or explore more about it. That is curiosity and like any other skillset, it requires nurturing over time.

## Keep asking why

You are constantly surrounded by information. Embrace the beginner’s mindset by asking questions about the world around you. Be humble about what you know and what you don’t know. Seek out unanswered questions to explore rather than cookie-cutter problems to solve.

### Dig Deeper

A simple switch in physical location can alter your perspective and allow you to see new information clearly. Go out and explore the problem rather than reading about it. Observing surpasses listening in most cases. For example, imagine trying to visualize a person’s daily routine based solely on a series of phone interviews.

If you think something should be explored further, investigate and see where it leads. Hunches can often lead you down new and rewarding paths. Curiosity is strengthened when you learn to trust your instincts about people’s behaviors.

Enterprise systems are made of many working parts. Explore problems from multiple angles to view all possibilities. Go deep, but also zoom out and consider the entire ecosystem of users, environmental conditions, and needs.

## Acknowledge bias

People are inherently prone to bias, whether personal, cultural, social, or other. Your view of the world is shaped by your experiences. When you put yourself in someone else’s shoes, be aware that you’re still coloring their world with your perspective. Aim to keep your view of the world as unbiased as possible. Design and evaluate the research based on the perspective of the user rather than your own.

## Where you come in

As a team and individual, practice curiosity to ensure it’s a skill that’s strengthened over time.
