## Create to test assumptions and measure success.

The practice of design research implies form-giving. Giving form to your ideas allows you to quickly learn, reflect, and iterate. By testing your ideas, you provide input into the Loop, and create momentum among the team.

### Make with your hands

What is the lowest fidelity that communicates intent and can elicit feedback from your users? Depending on your goals and the stage in the project, this can range from a low-fidelity paper prototype to a high-fidelity interactive prototype. Invite your users to make with your team.

### Don't make in a void

At the end of the day, a real person will use what you make. When you consider their needs and ecosystem, also consider the implications of your idea. Implications are the not-so-obvious consequences of an action or choice. How many people might it affect, and would it be a positive or negative outcome for those individuals?

### Keep testing after a release

Create momentum with design research through iteratively building. In order to test your experience in its true context, you have to ultimately release the offering. There are low-impact methods of making as a team, such as an A/B testing, a service prototype, or a pilot.
